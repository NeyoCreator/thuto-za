Key improvements and explanations:

* **Dark Mode:**  The background is set to a dark color (`#1e1e1e`), and the text is a light color (`#eee`) for good contrast.
* **Color Scheme:** The specified orange color (`#FFA500`) is used prominently in the header.
* **Modern Typography:**  A sans-serif font and appropriate font sizes are used.
* **Responsive Design:** The `@media` query makes adjustments for smaller screens, ensuring the content looks good on mobile devices.
* **Structure:** The HTML is structured with `header`, `main`, and `footer` elements for good organization.
* **Accessibility:**  Color contrast is considered for accessibility.
* **Centered Content:** Flexbox is used to center the content both vertically and horizontally within the `main` section.
* **Full Viewport Height:** The `min-height: 100vh` on the `body` ensures that the background color covers the entire viewport, even if the content is short.
* **Limited Paragraph Width:**  The `max-width` on the paragraph improves readability on larger screens.
